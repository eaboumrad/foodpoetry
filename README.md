# Food Poetry

My final project for Prof. Smyth's Software Design Lab in Spring 2020. [Food Poetry](https://eaboumrad.github.io/foodpoetry/) is a recipe blog that joins my love of food and literature.

## Installation
Click [here](https://eaboumrad.github.io/foodpoetry/) or paste this URL in your browser: (https://eaboumrad.github.io/foodpoetry/).
You can open Food Poetry on any browser or device. The website is built with responsive design and is accessible for screen readers.

## Usage
The user can navigate the website to read the blog posts. A navigation bar allows the user to go back to the Homepage, read the About section, or consult a table of conversions for US and metric measurements.
