            My mother loves butter more than I do,
            more than anyone. She pulls chunks off
            the stick and eats it plain, explaining
            cream spun around into butter! Growing up
            we ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon
            and butter, butter and cheese on green noodles,
            butter melting in small pools in the hearts
            of Yorkshire puddings, butter better
            than gravy staining white rice yellow,
            butter glazing corn in slipping squares,
            butter the lava in white volcanoes
            of hominy grits, butter softening
            in a white bowl to be creamed with white
            sugar, butter disappearing into
            whipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple,
            butter melted and curdy to pour
            over pancakes, butter licked off the plate
            with warm Alaga syrup. When I picture
            the good old days I am grinning greasy
            with my brother, having watched the tiger
            chase his tail and turn to butter. We are
            Mumbo and Jumbo’s children despite   
            historical revision, despite
            our parent’s efforts, glowing from the inside
            out, one hundred megawatts of butter.</pre><blockquote>
