        My mother loves butter more than I do,
        more than anyone. She pulls chunks off
        the stick and eats it plain, explaining
        cream spun around into butter! Growing up
        we ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon
        and butter, butter and cheese on green noodles,
        butter melting in small pools in the hearts
        of Yorkshire puddings, butter better
        than gravy staining white rice yellow,
        butter glazing corn in slipping squares,
        butter the lava in white volcanoes
        of hominy grits, butter softening
        in a white bowl to be creamed with white
        sugar, butter disappearing into
        whipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple,
        butter melted and curdy to pour
        over pancakes, butter licked off the plate
        with warm Alaga syrup. When I picture
        the good old days I am grinning greasy
        with my brother, having watched the tiger
        chase his tail and turn to butter. We are
        Mumbo and Jumbo’s children despite   
        historical revision, despite
        our parent’s efforts, glowing from the inside
        out, one hundred megawatts of butter.

<h1>Tahdig (Persian Rice)</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup kosher salt</li>
    <li>3 tbsp yogurt</li>
    <li>3 tbsp salted butter</li>
    <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Turmeric (optional for color and aroma)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring 6 cups of water, 1/2 cup of salt, and some turmeric to a boil.</li>
    <li>Rinse the rice (2 cups) and cook for 6-8 mins. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups of boiled rice with the yogurt.</li>
    <li>Melt the 3 tbsp of oil and 3 tbsp of butter in a non-stick pan. Add the rice you have mixed with the yogurt and level it with a spoon. Pile the remaining rice in the pan, mounding it toward the center.</li>
    <li>Dig 5-6 holes into the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon. This will let the steam out so the rice becomes crunchy.</li>
    <li>Cook the rice over medium heat, rotating the pan a quarter turn every 5 minutes for even browning. Cook until your start to see a golden crust begin to form at the sides of the pan, about 15 mins.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking another 15 to 20 minutes. The edges of the crust should be golden. Turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Carefully place a big plate on top of the non-stick pan and flip the pan. Enjoy your Tahdig!</li>
