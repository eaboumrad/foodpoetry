        When you kill it at the edge of the pan, you don't notice
        That the egg grows an eye in death.

        It is so small, it doesn't satisfy
        Even the most modest morning appetite.

        But it already watches, already stares at your world.
        What are its horizons, whose glassy-eyed perspectives?

        Does it see time, which moves carelessly through space?
        Eyeballs, eyeballs, cracked shells, chaos or order?

        Big questions for such a little eye at such an early hour.  
        And you – do you really want an answer?

        When you sit down, eye to eye, behind a table,
        You blind it soon enough with a crust of bread.

<p>This is a very simple recipe for a healthy, vegetarian breakfast. I decided to give it a Middle Eastern inspiration with the add of Sumac, a spice derived from berries and that has a characteristic acidity. The sauce is Middle Eastern, too: it's the classic lebanese Tahini sauce that my dad prepares when we make kebab at home. I decided to add a little smoked paprika to give it a little kick! The best part or this recipe is that you can roast the carrots and the beets in advance and assemble the bowls when you prefer.</p>

<p>You can make the bowl vegan by substituting the fried egg with chickpeas or lentils. If you are a meat lover, roasted chicken is perfect for this bowl. Variations on the bowl include all sorts of roasted vegetables: I've used roasted broccoli, cauliflower, and sweet potatoes. Instead of farro, you can use any whole grains: bulgur, quinoa, and brown rice all work very well with this recipe.</p>

<h2>Ingredients (Makes 2 servings)</h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup of pearled farro</li>
    <li>1 red beet</li>
    <li>2 medium carrots</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of Sumac</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 avocado</li>
    <li>a bunch of red radishes</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of Tahini</li>
    <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
    <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Cook the farro using instructions on the package. I chose to cook it in the rice cooker: place 1 cup of farro, 2 cups of water, and a pinch of salt in a rice cooker and set the timer for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Wash the beet, then cut out the top and the bottom. Place the beet in a small baking dish with half a cup of water. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes or until fork tender. The bigger the beet, the longer the cooking time. Once it's ready, remove the roasted beet from the baking dish and let it cool down. Then, using a paper towel, rub the beet: the skin should come off easily. If it doesn't, use a peeler. Cut the beet in thin slices.</li>
    <li>Peel the carrots and cut them into short sticks. Place in a bowl with one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, and a teaspoon of sumac and mix well. Lay the carrots on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and roast for 30 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Prepare the sauce: place one tablespoon of tahini in a small bowl and squeeze half a lemon into it, making sure to avoid the seeds. Mix with a fork until the tahini mix becomes lighter in color and thicker in texture. Then, add water little by little, until the mix becomes a creamy sauce. Add salt and smoked paprika and refrigerate. The sauce keeps well in the fridge for about a week.</li>
    <li>Slice the radishes and put aside.</li>
    <li>Melt one tablespoon of butter in a nonstick pan and fry the two eggs until they reach the desired texture.</li>
    <li>Cut the avocado in half and slice it.</li>
    <li>Assemble the bowl. Scoop some farro into the bowl, then place the carrots, the sliced beets, the radishes, one fried egg, and half the avocado on top of it. Serve with sauce on the side</li>
</ol>
