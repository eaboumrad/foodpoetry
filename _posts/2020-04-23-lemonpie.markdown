        <h2 id="h01">Ode to the Lemon</h2>
        <b>By Pablo Neruda</b>
        <blockquote cite="http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/pablo_neruda/poems/15734">
        <pre>
        From blossoms
        released
        by the moonlight,
        from an
        aroma of exasperated
        love,
        steeped in fragrance,
        yellowness
        drifted from the lemon tree,
        and from its plantarium
        lemons descended to the earth.

        Tender yield!
        The coasts,
        the markets glowed
        with light, with
        unrefined gold;
        we opened
        two halves
        of a miracle,
        congealed acid
        trickled
        from the hemispheres
        of a star,
        the most intense liqueur
        of nature,
        unique, vivid,
        concentrated,
        born of the cool, fresh
        lemon,
        of its fragrant house,
        its acid, secret symmetry.

        Knives
        sliced a small
        cathedral
        in the lemon,
        the concealed apse, opened,
        revealed acid stained glass,
        drops
        oozed topaz,
        altars,
        cool architecture.

        So, when you hold
        the hemisphere
        of a cut lemon
        above your plate,
        you spill
        a universe of gold,
        a
        yellow goblet
        of miracles,
        a fragrant nipple
        of the earth's breast,
        a ray of light that was made fruit,
        the minute fire of a planet.
