# Food Poetry: a blog of recipes and poems that express our love of food.

My final project [*Food Poetry*](https://eaboumrad.github.io/foodpoetry/) is a recipe blog with a twist. Every post represents a recipe, but it also contains a poem about one of the ingredients. 

## Motivations
Food is a complex cultural phenomenon and it can evoke feelings and memories in everyone of us. Poetry can often feel inaccessible, but there are plenty of writers who expressed their love of food in verse. Therefore, I decided to pair every recipe with a poem for a double purpose. On the one hand, the website makes poetry - which is often considered an elite literary form - accessible because the subject is something everyone can relate to: food. On the other hand, the poem that opens the post places the recipes under a new light, which elevates the food to something more than a household chore.
During the COVID-19 epidemic, many people are spending their free time cooking and reading. Therefore, I though that Food Poetry could be a good resource for the ones who, like me, are stuck at home during quarantine.
